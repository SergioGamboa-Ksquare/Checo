        <h1>History</h1>
        The Republic of Yucatan emerged as a response to the centralist government headed precisely by Antonio López de Santa Anna in 1835. The movement headed by Miguel Barbachano demanded a federal government, and failing to achieve it promoted Yucatan to be independent from Mexico. 
        <p>Prior to that, in the time line, in some portion of the same territorial space, there were settlements whose origin has not been scientifically confirmed and that possibly date from the end of the Pleistocene or the ice age (approximately 10,000 - 12,000 years ago), as seems to be deduced from the findings in the caves of Loltún and in the caverns of Tulum (Woman of the Palms and Young man of Chan Hol). </p>
        <p>In the remote past, 65 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous, in the north of the peninsular region, a meteorite or a fraction of it fell, which caused a global catastrophe by making the dinosaurs disappear from the face of the earth and cause the so-called Chicxulub Crater. </p>
